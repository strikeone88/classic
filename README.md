It was 2005, I was 17 and the world was (to my eyes) an awesome place full of new interesting things to explore and try. And code in BASIC, ASM and C/C++ was my main and only hobby all day long * _sigh_ * ...

Before thee, a collection of my old experiments, nice crazy code from way back as of 2005, of the days when I was a fresh naive person in college, when I wanted to make everything from scratch (compilers, OSes, file systems and more!) and I had time to literally breathe code every hour of the day.

Memories of endless nights of coding on MS-DOS using [edit.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS_Editor), torturing myself by refusing to use any GUI and using [floppy discs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk) to download a bunch of text files with juicy information each week when I had the privilege my dad and mom let me go to a internet café. Which btw, never had any coffee!

Enjoy (at your own risk)!
