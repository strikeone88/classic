Someday optimize kgfx to support linear frame buffers.
Change the INT10 calls for DPMI calls.

If when the engine is finished the Alpha value is still unused, optimize
kgfx to avoid writes and reads of alpha channel.

LineObject: Clipping stuff is not optimized.
gPerspective
gFrustrum

make ClearColorBuffer work only with the viewport?
Z-buffering?
When using LINE_OBJECT interpolate between color values?

Add accumulation buffer schemes.
Camera!!!!!!!

Make EVERYTHING homogeneous so that no conversion from-to FP/INT is needed.

Clean UP!!!!!!!!!



The triangle converter is a bit buggy, you should get the book and see the
things I wrote there to fix everything.
