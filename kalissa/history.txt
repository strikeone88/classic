** Kalissa Version 0.11 (KS-0-11.RP):
Floating point constants supported.

** Kalissa Version 0.10 (KS-0-10.RP):
color-layer
Adaptive filter changed to multiplicative filter.

** Kalissa Version 0.09 (KS-0-09.RP):
Check syntax for new stuff
bf3

** Kalissa Version 0.08 (KS-0-08.RP):

Additive and subtractive blending supported for images, attribute is called
(redundantly) additive. Blending system changed, now the percentile of blend
is used to lower or raise the intensity of the source image, you can use a
slash to specify the intensity of the background image, the "reverse-order"
attribute can be used to reverse the images when using subtractive blending.
Red, Green and Blue attributes added to change each component range. Filters
edge-enhance and edge-detect added. "first" attribute added to force certain
post-draws be pre-draws.

** Kalissa Version 0.07 (KS-0-07.RP):

Attributes "ix, iy, iw, and ih" added to clip an area of an image, so far
only BMPs are supported. Attributes 'tcolor' and 'pcolor' added, the first
one is the transparent color, and the second is the primary color to be
modified or drawn, both work with images, faders and mirrors. New object
'fader' added to fade a rectangular area, also 'mirror' that is used to do
vertical or horizontal flips. Attribute "blend" added to the image inline,
the first form uses a boolean to indicate if the image should be blended at
75%, the second forms specified the percent of blending. If a delayed filter
was used with the 'as' attribute, the filter would never be drawn, this bug
has been fixed. Hidden option -bp added to indicate the usage of Becky. The
attribute "s-tcolor" added to set a transparent SCREEN color when drawing
images that also have transparency. Object 'sprayer' added to make an area
look a bit sprayed. The "value" attribute is optional, if you wish just put
the string literal and Kalissa will understand. The tab meta char can be
used to put four spaces or longtab for eight space. Attribute "align" added
to align text (only BF2!!) alignment can be left, right, justify or center,
attribute value MAX can be used in w and h to set to max parent length. New
directions added "up", "down", "left" and "right" all of them work in the
sprayer only (for now), bug with the fader was fixed (used height and a var
to determine if vertical or horizontal fadin). When using faders, if the
second percentile is omitted, a A2A fade is done instead of A2B. Attribute
"i-pcolor" added to draw only one primary color of an image. New Object
'negative' added (behaves like image) to make negative an area. The BMP
writer fixed to add correct XPelsPerMeter and YPelsPerMeter values. The
default font is now verdana.bf2.


** Kalissa Version 0.06 (KS-0-06.RP):

New attribute 'font-space' added to change the default BF2 font space,
also new object named 'filter' has been added to apply graphics filter
from 1x1 to 15x15, it's still beta but it works for now, just use the
value to specify dimm and then each element, all separated by comma.
Predefined filters: soften-lo, soften-med, sharpen-lo, sharpen-med
and shatter. One last bug with the writer was fixed, now ALL widths
are supported (even if not divisible by 4). Three types of filtering
fully supported: normal, adaptive and incremental. New attribute "as"
added to change behavior of the object. Filter layers supported. A
very small bug when opening multiple surfaces in the same file has
been fixed.

** Kalissa Version 0.05 (KS-0-05.RP):

A bug with the text has been fixed, now if relative Xs and Ys are given
for a text box the thing will work correctly. If there is any error the
surface won't be written to the disk (updated KS-TGA). Absolute percs
supported for x/y. New patterns added (hline and vline) to make grids
easier. Also, if XMS is not found the normal on-disk buffer is used. A
small bug related to the BMP reading was fixed.

** Kalissa Version 0.04 (KS-0-04.RP):

New objects added inv-row and inv-column, both work exactly as row and
column accordingly just that instead of moving down (column) or right (row)
it moves up (inv-column) or left (inv-row). All ISO 8859-1 symbolic entities
are now supported, plus the following: quot, lt, gt and amp.

** Kalissa Version 0.03 (KS-0-03.RP):

Now capable of reading bmp files and inlining them to the output using
the object "inline-bmp", note that only 24 bit BMPs are allowed also
the width and height must NOT exceed 32767. There was a bug when the
BF2 text was used and character above 127 were in the string, a simple
sign thing, it's fixed. The Kalissa TGA Writer has been updated, now
the BMP-24 format is supported, to select it just add the output format
name in parenthesis at the end of the surface definition. The double
quote can now be used with the &quote; meta character.

** Kalissa Version 0.02 (KS-0-02.RP):

Bug fixed when drawing text and the justifiying algo doesn't work.
Absolute percentiles now supported for width/height, just type %%
instead of just %. Relative width/height supported using -num.

** Kalissa Version 0.01 (KS-0-01.RP):

Able to format rectangles, columns, rows and two types of text,
type BF2 and RFX. Produces 24-bit TrueVision Targa files, the
width and height is not limited. RGB values can be inlined in
the source using the <> operator. Uses the XMS helper to create
the surface when XMS is available.
