020H-03fH Interrupt Controller

==============================================================================

 DMA (Direct Memory Access) is used for high-speed data transfers between I/O
 devices and memory without intervention of the CPU.  It is typically employed
 by diskette and hard disk drivers, but it could be used for streaming tape or
 any other device as long as it does not interfere with the operation of other
 standard devices.

 The original PC supports four 8-bit DMA channels, across a 20-bit address
 space, using an Intel 8237A DMA controller chip.  The İATŞ supports 7 DMA
 channels by cascading a second 8237A DMA controller.  The differences between
 PC and AT DMA are covered at the end of this section.

081H-08fH DMA page registers.
      To select a starting address for a DMA operation, do an OUT to the page
      register (ports 81H-83H) for the selected channel then set the base
      address (ports 00H-07H) for the channel.  A page register is set with a
      4-bit value that represents bits 16-19 of the 20-bit DMA address.  Since
      the current address is a 16-bit value, it is not possible to cross a 64K
      boundary (eg, address 1000:0, 2000:0, etc.) with a DMA operation.
