*** Vanessa 0.03 (VL-0-03.RP):

The new VO file format allows section export/import which implies that you
can import and export any symbol in a section. The RedStar format formerly
known as RSX has been renamed to VX or Vanessa eXecutable, primarily because
it relies very much in the section export/import information now introduced
in the VO files, therefore it has a very good relationship with VOs, and with
Vanessa, it should be her executable format, and now it is... VX format is
now COMPLETELY supported. Cynthia executables changed a bit in the header to
allow page alignment.

*** Vanessa 0.02 (VL-0-02.RP):

In the previous version, when an undefined symbol was found a message was
shown but without the name of the module that used the symbol, but in this
version, Vanessa does show the name of the module, an undefined symbol
warning is shown ONCE per module. A slight mistake in an error message was
fixed, instead of saying "runtime fixups" it was supposed to be "runtime
section fixups", now it says "section fixups" to make things clearer. The
VO format is now much better documented than before. A very small bug with
the -F option was found and repaired, when you used -F and specified to
link any library file, the externals in the library were not detected.

*** Vanessa 0.01 (VL-0-01.RP):

Vanessa "The Official RedStar Linker", is ready, fully capable of linking
big VO files. Supports a variety of output executable formats, and has
special executable formats such as SBX, and Cynthia Executables, up to
this version, RSX are not supported, primarily because the specification
is not done yet.
