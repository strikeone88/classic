    80 B B S        The name of the creator of the object file (string),
                    also specifies the version of the VO file, the first
                    byte is the major-version and the other byte is the
                    minor-version in BCD.

    90 S D          Library specification, the string is the name of the
                    creator of the library file, the double word is the
                    public symbols dictionary in Aurora on-disk format.

                    The data tied to a symbol is the offset of the VO file
                    that contains it.

    82 S D B B      The Content-Type is object code specification, the
                    string is the name of the source file, the dword is
                    the offset of the symbols area, the byte is the
                    count of sections in the object file and the last
                    byte the count of groups.

                    ** (OBJECT-CODE) Expects: 83

    83 B B D B D D  Describes a section, the first byte is the section
                    name, then the section class, and then the section
                    length, next byte is the section attributes, bits 7-5
                    describe the alignment and bit 4 the combine mode.

                    The next dword is the offset of the binary data, and
                    the last one is the section origin. If the length is
                    zero then the length of the binary area will be used.

                    Alignment can be byte (0), word (1), dword (2),
                    paragraph (3), 256 bytes (4) and page (5).

                    Combine mode can be public (0) or private (1).

                    ** (SECTION-DEF) Expects: 83, 84, 86, 87

    84 B B          Defines a group, the first byte indicates how many
                    sections belong to this group, the other byte is the
                    index of the name of the group.

                    ** (GROUP-DEF) Expects: 85

    85 B            Indicates that the given section belongs to the
                    previously defined group.

                    ** (GROUP-MEMBER) Expects: 84, 85, 87

    86 B S          Specifies export/import name. If bit-0 is zero
                    then it indicates export, otherwise import, the
                    seven bits remaining are reserved. The string is
                    the name to be used as export/import name. When
                    exporting, all the publics defined in the section
                    will be exported using its name. When importing,
                    the externals will be imported using their names.

                    The capacity to export and/or import symbols
                    during runtime, was created primarily for the
                    Vanessa eXecutable format.

                    ** (EXPIMP-NAME) Expects: 83, 84, 87

    87 B D          Indicates where the entry point of the program
                    is located, the byte is the section index and
                    the double word the offset. If the index is zero
                    then no entry point exists.

                    ** (ENTRY-POINT) Expects: 88

    88 D D D D      Indicates the offsets of the publics, externals,
                    debug-info and fixups areas. An offset of zero
                    indicates that the area does not exist.

                    ** (INFO-AREAS) Expects: 89, 8A

    89              End of object file.

                    ** (VO-END) Expects: Nothing

    8A              Reserved for future use.

                         * Note: INDICES are given from ONE, NOT ZERO. *

    In the Publics-Area, each entry is variable length, the first byte
    is called PUBLIC-INFO and gives information about the actual length
    of the entry, the fields that follow PUBLIC-INFO are SECTION, SYMBOL
    and OFFSET (in order), SECTION is always byte-sized and is optional
    because there is a field in PUBLIC-INFO that can be used to store it
    if it fits; the PUBLIC-INFO is defined as follows:

    Bits    Name        Description                        * PUBLIC-INFO *
    컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
    7       SYMBOL-LEN  Specifies the length of the SYMBOL field.
                        0: Byte
                        1: Word

    6-5     OFFSET-LEN  Specifies the length of the OFFSET field.
                        0: Byte
                        1: Word
                        2: Tryad
                        3: Dword

    4-0     SECTION     Specifies the section index. If the value stored
                        here is non-zero, then the SECTION field that
                        should follow PUBLIC-INFO will not exist.
    컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

    Now, the externals are real simple, just a list of symbol indices,
    each followed by a section index, the first takes a word and the
    second a byte, note that the section index is written ONLY if the
    section is going to be imported. When fixing, the target type may
    indicate EXTERNAL SYMBOL, if so, the index does not refer to an
    index within this table, but instead a SYMBOL-INDEX.

    The fixups area contains a list of areas that need to be modified
    with information known only at linking time. The entry fields are
    FIXUP-INFO, SECTION, OFFSET, and TARGET. The SECTION field is just
    a byte that specifies the section index to fix. The FIXUP-INFO is
    defined as follows:

    Bits    Name        Description                         * FIXUP-INFO *
    컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
    7-6     OFFSET-LEN  The length of the OFFSET field.
                        0: Byte
                        1: Word
                        2: Tryad
                        3: Dword

    5       FIXUP-MODE  The fixup mode, can be ABSOLUTE (0) or RELATIVE (1),
                        when ABSOLUTE the offsets are calculated from the
                        beginning of the SECTION-GROUP, otherwise it is
                        calculated from the CURRENT relative offset.

    4-3     TARGET-TYPE Describes the type and size of the target.
                        0: Section (Byte)
                        1: Group (Byte)
                        2: External Symbol (Byte)
                        3: External Symbol (Word)

    2-0     AREA-INFO   Specifies the length and type of the area to
                        be fixed.

                        0: 16-bit Offset
                        1: 16-bit Base
                        2: 32-bit Offset
                        3: 32-bit Base
                        4: 32-bit Pointer
                        5: 48-bit Pointer
                        6: 64-bit Pointer
                        7: Reserved
    컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
          * NOTE: ABSOLUTE mode is valid only if AREA-INFO is an OFFSET. *

    The debug information area contains variable length entries (usual)
    the fields are DEBUG-INFO, OFFSET and LINE.

    Bits    Name        Description                         * DEBUG-INFO *
    컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
    7-6     INFO-TYPE   Specifies the type of the entry.
                        0: Line-Number

    5-4     LINE-LEN    Specifies the length of the LINE field.
                        0: Byte
                        1: Word
                        2: Tryad
                        3: Dword

    3-2     OFFSET-LEN  Specifies the length of the OFFSET field.
                        0: Byte
                        1: Word
                        2: Tryad
                        3: Dword
    컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

    As of the writing of this spec, only line-number debug information
    is supported.

    Note that when offsets to areas are given, the FIRST DWORD at that
    offset specifies the LENGTH of that area and the next double word
    the count of elements in that area. The binary data is also an area
    but without the element count dword (just length).

    When using tryads, the lower 16-bits are written first and then the
    upper 8-bits (little-endian format).

    Fixing is the MOST important process when linking, a slight mistake
    and you will get a mega-bugged proggy, this happens because of one
    simple reason: "Fixups Are The Glue That Hold VOs Together", these
    are used to connect one VO to another, one mistake and the offsets
    are all wrong, and that means, incorrect memory accesses and jumps
    that miss their targets.

    EVERY OFFSET is given as a LOCAL-LOGICAL-ADRESS, that is, relative
    from the LOGICAL-ORIGIN of the SECTION where the public or fixup,
    or whatever is located.

    Now, both the FIXUP-OFFSET and the TARGET-OFFSET must be converted
    into PHYSICAL-ADDRESSES, (aka) physically from zero, this is done
    by subtracting the LOGICAL-ORIGIN from the LOCAL-LOGICAL-ADDRESS,
    and then adding the SECTION-PHYSICAL-OFFSET. It is recommended to
    build an unfixed raw image file, where the binary areas of all the
    sections are written BEFORE the fixing stage, this way you can get
    physical section offsets quite easily.

    The next step depends on FIXUP-MODE. If it is ABSOLUTE, you must
    convert the PHYSICAL-ADDRESS into GLOBAL-LOGICAL-ADDRESS, this is
    done by finding the base group (BASE) of the target's section, that
    is the FIRST section of the GROUP that contains the section of the
    target. And adding BASE-LOGICAL-ORIGIN to PHYSICAL-ADDRESS, and then
    subtracting BASE-PHYSICAL-ADDRESS.

    If the FIXUP-MODE is RELATIVE then the PHYSICAL-ADDRESS is converted
    into the fixup's LOCAL-LOGICAL-ADDRESS, that is, a logical address
    seen from inside the section where the fixup is located, this is
    easily done by subtracting the fixup's SECTION-PHYSICAL-OFFSET and
    then adding the fixup's SECTION-LOGICAL-ORIGIN.

    Once you have either a GLOBAL/LOCAL LOGICAL-ADDRESS the last step
    is simple, just add the resulting address to the value located at
    the fixup's offset, remember that you have the fixups's AREA-INFO
    that indicates how long the value to be fixed is.
